# wp-cloner

Clone posts, pages and custom post types easily

## Overview

This plugin allows you to clone posts, pages and even items from custom posts types with a single click and it will copy all the content and metadata from the original element.

## Requirements

- WordPress 5.x
- PHP 5.6+

## Installation

Clone/download the repo and install the plugin by unziping the contents of the zip into the `wp-content/plugins` folder of your WP installation, rename the resulting folder to `wp-cloner` and activate it through the WordPress admin dashboard.

Once installed you will see a 'Cloner' entry on the left-side menu, click it and you will see the options page. There you will be able to specify on which content the Clone command will be available.

Then just head up to 'Posts', 'Pages' or your custom post type listing and hover the element you want to clone, then click the Clone action and wait until you're redirected to edit the contents of the duplicate.

Profit!
